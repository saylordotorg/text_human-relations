    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_p01">Business and professional meetings are a part of the communication climate of any business. Some view meetings as boring, pointless, and futile exercises, while others see them as opportunities to exchange information and produce results. A combination of preparation and execution makes all the difference. Remember, too, that meetings do not have to take place in a physical space where the participants meet face to face. Instead, a number of technological tools make it possible to hold virtual meetings in which the participants are half a world away from one another. Virtual meetings are formally arranged gatherings where participants, located in distinct geographic locations, come together via the Internet.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preparation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p01">A meeting, like a problem-solving group, needs a clear purpose statement. The specific goal for the specific meeting will clearly relate to the overall goal of the group or committee. Determining your purpose is central to an effective meeting and getting together just to get together is called a party, not a meeting. Do not schedule a meeting just because you met at the same time last month or because it is a standing committee. Members will resent the intrusion into their schedules and quickly perceive the lack of purpose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p02">Similarly, if the need for a meeting arises, do not rush into it without planning. A poorly planned meeting announced at the last minute is sure to be less than effective. People may be unable to change their schedules, may fail to attend, or may impede the progress and discussion of the group because of their absence. Those who attend may feel hindered because they needed more time to prepare and present comprehensive results to the group or committee.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p03">If a meeting is necessary, and a clear purpose can be articulated, then you’ll need to decide how and where to meet. Distance is no longer an obstacle to participation, as we will see later in this section when we explore some of the technologies for virtual meetings. However, there are many advantages to meeting in person. People communicate not just with words but also with their body language—facial expressions, hand gestures, head nodding or head shaking, and posture. These subtleties of communication can be key to determining how group members really feel about an issue or question. Meeting in real time can be important, too, as all group members have the benefit of receiving new information at the same time. For purposes of our present discussion, we will focus on meetings taking place face to face in real time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p04">If you have a purpose statement for the meeting, then it also follows that you should be able to create an agenda or a list of topics to be discussed. You may need to solicit information from members to formulate an agenda, and this premeeting contact can serve to encourage active participation. The agenda will have a time, date, place, and method of interaction noted, as well as a list of participants. It will also have a statement of purpose, a list of points to be considered, and a brief summary of relevant information that relates to each point. The start and end times need to be clearly indicated somewhere on the agenda, and it is always a good idea to leave time at the end for questions and additional points that individual members may want to share. If the meeting has an emotional point or theme, or the news is negative, plan for additional time for discussion, clarification, and recycling of conversations as the participants process the information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p05">If you are planning an intense work session, you need to consider the number of possible interactions among the participants and limit them. Smaller groups are generally more productive. If you are gathering to present information or to motivate the sales staff, a large audience, where little interaction is expected, is appropriate. Each member has a role, and attention to how and why they are interacting will produce the best results. Review the stages of group formation in view of the idea that a meeting is a short-term group. You can anticipate a “forming” stage, and if roles are not clear, there may be a bit of “storming” before the group establishes norms and becomes productive. Adding additional participants for no clear reason will only make the process more complex and may produce negative results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p06">Inviting the participants via e-mail has become increasingly common across business and industry. Software programs like Microsoft Outlook allow you to initiate a meeting request and receive an “accept” or “decline” response that makes the invitation process organized and straightforward. Reliance on a software program, however, may not be enough to encourage and ensure participation. A reminder on the individual’s computer may go off fifteen minutes prior to the meeting, but if they are away from their computer or if Outlook is not running, the reminder will go unseen and unheard. A reminder e-mail on the day of the meeting, often early in the morning, can serve as a personal effort to highlight the activities of the day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p07">If you are the person responsible for the room reservation, confirm the reservation a week before the meeting and again the day before the meeting. Redundancy in the confirmation process can help eliminate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double-booking</a><span class="glossdef">Misunderstanding in which two meetings are scheduled at the same time in the same place.</span></span> a room, where two meetings are scheduled at the same time. If technology is required at the meeting, such as a microphone, conference telephone, or laptop and projector, make sure you confirm their reservation at the same time as you confirm the meeting room reservation. Always personally inspect the room and test these systems prior to the meeting. There is nothing more embarrassing than introducing a high-profile speaker, such as the company president, and then finding that the PowerPoint projector is not working properly.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conducting the Meeting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p01">The world is a stage and a meeting is a performance, the same as an interview or speech presentation. Each member has a part to perform and they should each be aware of their roles and responsibilities prior to the meeting. Everyone is a member of the group, ranging from new members to full members. If you can reduce or eliminate the storming stage, all the better. A clearly defined agenda can be a productive tool for this effort.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p02">People may know each other by role or title but may not be familiar with each other. Brief introductions can serve to establish identity, credibility, and help the group transition to performance. The purpose of the meeting should be clearly stated, and if there are rules or guidelines that require a specific protocol, they should be introduced.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p03">Mary Ellen Guffey<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_022">Guffey, M. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Essentials of business communication</em> (7th ed.). Mason, OH: Thomson/Wadsworth.</span> provides a useful participant checklist that is adapted here for our use:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Arrive on time and stay until the meeting adjourns (unless there are prior arrangements).</li>
            <li>Leave the meeting only for established breaks or emergencies.</li>
            <li>Be prepared and have everything you need on hand.</li>
            <li>Turn off cell phones and personal digital assistants.</li>
            <li>Follow the established protocol for turn taking.</li>
            <li>Respect time limits.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate professionalism in your verbal and nonverbal interactions.</li>
            <li>Communicate interest and stay engaged in the discussion.</li>
            <li>Avoid tangents and side discussions.</li>
            <li>Respect space and don’t place your notebook or papers all around you.</li>
            <li>Clean up after yourself.</li>
            <li>Engage in polite conversation after the conclusion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p04">If you are cast in the role of meeting leader, you may need to facilitate the discussion and address conflict. The agenda serves as your guide and you may need to redirect the discussion to the topic, but always demonstrate respect for each and every member. You may also need to intervene if a point has reached a stalemate in terms of conflict (this text offers specific guidelines for managing interpersonal conflict that apply here).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p05">There has been quite a discussion on the role of seating arrangements in meeting within the field of business communication. Generally, a table that is square, rectangular, or U-shaped has a fixed point at which the attention is directed, often referred to as the head of the table. This space is often associated with power, status, and hierarchy and may play an important role in the flow of interactions across the meeting. If information is to be distributed and presented from administration to managers, for example, a table with a clear focal point for the head or CEO may be indicated. Tables that are round, or tables arranged in a circular pattern, allow for a more egalitarian model of interaction, reducing the hierarchical aspects while reinforcing the clear line of sight among all participants. If a meeting requires intense interaction and collaboration, generally a round table or a circular pattern is indicated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p06">Some meetings do not call for a table but rather rows of seats all facing toward the speaker; you probably recognize this arrangement from many class lectures you have attended. For relatively formal meetings in which information is being delivered to a large number of listeners and little interaction is desired, seating in rows is an efficient use of space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p07">Transitions are often the hardest part of any meeting. Facilitating the transition from one topic to the next may require you to create links between each point. You can specifically note the next point on the agenda and verbally introduce the next speaker or person responsible for the content area. Once the meeting has accomplished its goals in the established time frame, it is time to facilitate the transition to a conclusion. You may conclude by summarizing what has been discussed or decided and what actions the group members are to take as a result of the meeting. If there is a clear purpose for holding a subsequent meeting, discuss the time and date and specifically note assignments for next time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p08">Feedback is an important part of any communication interaction. Minutes are a written document that serves to record the interaction and can provide an opportunity for clarification. Minutes often appear as the agenda with notes in relation to actions taken during the meeting or specific indications of who is responsible for what before the next meeting. In many organizations, minutes of the meeting are tentative, like a rough draft, until they are approved by the members of the group or committee. Normally minutes are sent within a week of the meeting if it is a monthly event and more quickly if the need to meet more frequently has been determined. If your organization does not call for minutes, you can still benefit by reviewing your notes after a meeting and comparing them with those of others to make sure you understood what was discussed and did not miss—or misinterpret—any key information.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Technology to Facilitate Meetings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_p01">Given the widespread availability and increasingly low cost of electronic communication, technologies that once served to bring people together across continents and time zones are now also serving people in the same geographic area. Rather than traveling (by plane, car, or even elevator within the same building) to a central point for a face-to-face interaction, busy and cost-conscious professionals often choose to see and hear each other via one of many different electronic interface technologies. It is important to be aware of the dimensions of nonverbal communication that are lost in a virtual meeting compared to an in-person meeting. Nevertheless, these technologies are a boon to today’s business organizations, and knowing how to use them is a key skill for all job seekers. We will discuss the technologies by category, beginning with audio-only, then audio-visual, and finally social media.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audio-Only Interactions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p01">The simplest form of audio-only interaction is, of course, a telephone call. Chances are that you have been using the phone all your life, yet did you know that some executives hire professional voice coaches to help them increase their effectiveness in phone communication? When you stop to think about it, we use a great many audio-only modes of communication, ranging from phone calls and voice-activated telephone menus to radio interviews, public address systems, dictation recording systems, and computer voice recognition technology. The importance of audio communication in the business world has increased with the availability of conference calls, web conferences, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communications.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p02">Your voice has qualities that cannot be communicated in written form, and you can use these qualities to your advantage as you interact with colleagues. If you are sending a general informative message to all employees, an e-mail may serve you well, but if you are congratulating one employee on receiving an industry award, your voice as the channel carries your enthusiasm.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p03">Take care to pay attention to your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pronunciation</a><span class="glossdef">The way a word or phrase sounds when stated orally.</span></span> of words, stating them correctly in normal ways, and avoiding words that you are not comfortable with as you may mispronounce them. Mispronunciation can have a negative impact on your reputation or perceived credibility. Instead of using complicated words that may cause you to stumble, choose a simple phrase if you can or learn to pronounce the word correctly before you use it in a formal interactive setting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p04">Your voice quality, volume, and pitch also influence how your spoken words are interpreted. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quality</a><span class="glossdef">Emotional tone of one’s voice.</span></span> often refers to emotional tone of your voice, from happy and enthusiastic to serious or even sad. In most business situations, it is appropriate to speak with some level of formality yet avoid sounding stilted or arrogant. Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">volume</a><span class="glossdef">Loudness or softness of one’s voice.</span></span> (the loudness of your voice) should be normal, but do make sure your listeners can hear you. In some situations, you may be using a directional microphone that only amplifies your voice signal if you speak directly into it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p05">If your audience includes English learners, remember that speaking louder (i.e., shouting) does not help them to understand you any better than speaking in a normal tone. Your word choices will make a much more significant impact when communicating across cultures; strive to use direct sentences and avoid figures of speech that do not translate literally.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pitch</a><span class="glossdef">Frequency, high or low, of one’s voice.</span></span> refers to the frequency, high or low, of your voice. A pleasant, natural voice will have some variation in pitch. A speaker with a flat pitch, or a monotone (one-tone) voice, is often interpreted as being bored and often bores his or her listeners.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p07">If you are leaving a voice mail, state all the relevant information in concise, clear terms, making sure to speak slowly; don’t forget to include your contact information, even if you think the person already knows your phone number. Imagine you were writing down your phone number as you recite it and you will be better able to record it at a “listener-friendly” speed. Don’t leave a long, rambling voice mail message. You may later wish you had said less, and the more content you provide the more you increase the possibility for misunderstandings without your being present for clarification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audio-Visual Interactions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p01">Rather than call each other, we often call and interact in both audio and visual ways via the Internet. There are several ways to interface via audio and video, and new technologies in this area are being invented all the time. For example, VoIP software allows the participants to see and hear each other across time and distance with one-on-one calls and video conferencing. The audio portion of the call comes through a headset, and the callers see each other on their computer monitors, as if they were being broadcast on television. This form of audio-visual communication is quickly becoming a low- or no-cost business tool for interaction.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p02">If you are going to interact via audio and visual signals, make sure you are prepared. Appropriate dress, setting, and attitude are all required. The integration of a visual signal to the traditional phone call means that nonverbal gestures can now be observed in real time and can both aid and detract from the message.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p03">If you are unfamiliar with the technology, practice with it before your actual business interaction. Try out the features with a friend and know where to find and access the information. If the call doesn’t go as planned, or the signal isn’t what you expected or experienced in the past, keep a good attitude and try again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Social Media</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p01">Online communities, forums, blogs, tweets, cloud computing, and avatar-activated environments are some of the continually developing means of social media being harnessed by the business world. The Internet is increasingly promoting tools and platforms for people to interact. From bulletin boards that resemble the FreeNet posts of years past, to interactive environments like Second Life, people are increasingly representing and interpreting themselves online.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p02">Humans seek interaction, and this has led to new ways to market, advertise, and interact; however, caution is warranted when engaging in social media online. When you use these media, remember a few simple cautions:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Not everything is as it appears. The individuals on the forum may not all be who they represent themselves to be.</li>
                <li>The words you write and the images you send, regardless of how much you trust the recipient, may become public and can remain online forever.</li>
                <li>Always consider what you access and what you post and how it represents you and your employer, even if you think others cannot know where you work or who you are.</li>
                <li>Be aware that Internet service providers (ISPs) are required by law to archive information concerning the use and traffic of information that can become available under subpoena.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Forums</a><span class="glossdef">Theme-based websites that gather a community of individuals dedicated to a common interest.</span></span> are often theme-based websites that gather a community of individuals dedicated to a common interest. From owner-enthusiast websites that celebrate the new Mini Cooper, where owners discuss modifications and sell parts to each other, to forums that emphasize a viewpoint, such as the Life After the Oil Crash (LATOC) discussion board, affectionately called doomers, people come together to compare notes around areas of interest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Professional networking sites</a><span class="glossdef">A site that allows people to link to and interact with others who work in their industry or related ones.</span></span> such as LinkedIn allow people to link to, and interact with, others who work in their industry or related ones. More general social media sites include MySpace and Facebook, which also present threaded discussions and dynamic interfaces with groups that may or may not be limited to those that user intends. Interactive writing platforms such as blogs, wikis, and cloud computing involve having common documents stored on the Internet, which can be accessed from multiple sites at once, further facilitating the interaction. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Blogs</a><span class="glossdef">Web pages with periodic posts that may or may not feature feedback responses from readers.</span></span> are Web pages with periodic posts that may or may not feature feedback responses from readers. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Wikis</a><span class="glossdef">Collaborations on web content that are created and edited by users.</span></span> are collaborations on web content that are created and edited by users. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cloud computing</a><span class="glossdef">Involves secure access of files from anywhere as information is stored remotely.</span></span> involves secure access of files from anywhere as information is stored remotely.

In these environments, users can meet others and make friends, participate in activities, and create and trade virtual property and services.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p05">Business and industry organizations may also incorporate posts and threaded discussions but often under a password-protected design on a company’s intranet or other limited-access platform. Employees may use their business-provided computer equipment to access sites that are not business related (if not specifically blocked), but all information associated with each business’s computer is subject to inspection, archival, and supervision.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p06">Every computer is assigned an Internet protocol or IP address. The IP address can be specifically traced back to the original user, or at least to the computer itself and to who is responsible for its use. From an e-mail via one of the free sites (e.g., Juno, Google’s Gmail, or Yahoo! Mail) to cloud computing and wikis, your movements across the web leave clear “footprints.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p07">Whether you maintain a personal web page or a blog or engage with peers and colleagues via Twitter, take care when considering what personal information to make public. Privacy is an increasing issue online and your safety is a priority. Always represent yourself and your organization with professionalism, knowing that what you search for and how you use your business computer can and often is subject to inspection.</p>

                    <li>Take notes in one of your classes as if they were the official minutes of a meeting. Does the class “meeting” have a purpose? What preparations were made and what technology was used? Is there a follow-up or a plan for the next class meeting? Compare your notes with another student to see if you understood all the information conveyed in the class.</li>
                    <li>Collaborate with one or more classmates and contribute to a computing cloud or a wiki. What was the activity like? Did you learn new information that you would not have learned by studying individually?</li>
                    <li>Make an audio recording of your voice and listen to it. Are there aspects of your voice quality, pronunciation, or delivery style that you would like to improve? Practice daily and make more recordings until you notice improvement.</li>
