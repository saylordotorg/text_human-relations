    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_p01">When employees of an organization vote to unionize, the process for collective bargaining begins. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Collective bargaining</a><span class="glossdef">The process of negotiating an agreement between management and employees.</span></span> is the process of negotiations between the company and representatives of the union. You probably remember our discussion on negotiations in <a class="xref" href="fwk-122425-ch10#fwk-122425-ch10">Chapter 9 "Handle Conflict and Negotiation"</a>. Many of the tips in that chapter can help you should you ever be in a position to negotiate on behalf of a union or management.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch11_s003_p01">The goal is for management and the union to reach a contract agreement, which is put into place for a specified period of time. Once this time is up, a new contract is negotiated. In this section, we will discuss the components of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Process of Collective Bargaining</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p01">In any bargaining agreement, certain management rights are not negotiable, including the right to manage and operate the business, hire, promote, or discharge employees. However, in the negotiated agreement there may be a process outlined by the union for how these processes should work. Management rights also include the ability of the organization to direct the work of the employees and to establish operational policies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p02">Another important point in the collective bargaining process is the aspect of union security. Obviously, it is in the union’s best interest to collect dues from members and recruit as many new members as possible. In the contract, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">checkoff provision</a><span class="glossdef">The employer, on behalf of the union, automatically deducts dues from union members’ paychecks.</span></span> may be negotiated. This provision occurs when the employer, on behalf of the union, automatically deducts dues from union members’ paychecks. This ensures that a steady stream of dues is paid to the union.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p03">To recruit new members, the union may require something called a union shop. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">union shop</a><span class="glossdef">Requires a person to join the union within a certain time period of joining the organization.</span></span> requires a person to join the union within a certain time period of joining the organization. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">right-to-work states</a><span class="glossdef">Laws passed in twenty-two states that prohibit requirements to join a union or pay dues and fees to a union.</span></span> a union shop may be illegal. Twenty-two states have passed right-to-work laws, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_f01">Figure 11.6 "Map of Right-to-Work States"</a>. These laws prohibit a requirement to join a union or pay dues and fees to a union. To get around these laws, agency shops were created. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agency shop</a><span class="glossdef">Similar to a union shop, except that workers do not have to join the union but still must pay union dues.</span></span> is similar to a union shop in that workers do not have to join the union but still must pay union dues.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">closed shop</a><span class="glossdef">A type of union agreement in which a person must be a union member to be hired; it was made illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act.</span></span> used to be a mechanism for a steady flow of membership. In this arrangement, a person must be a union member to be hired. This, however, was made illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act. According to a study by CNBC, all twenty-two right-to-work states are in the top twenty-five states for having the best workforces.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_013">“Best Workforces Are in Right to Work States,” Redstate, June 30, 2011, accessed August 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.redstate.com/laborunionreport/2011/06/30/best-workforces-are-in-right-to-work-states-survey-finds/">http://www.redstate.com/laborunionreport/2011/06/30/best-workforces-are-in-right-to-work-states-survey-finds/</a>.</span> However, according to the AFL-CIO, the average worker in a right-to-work state makes $5,333 less per year than other workers.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_014">“Right to Work for Less,” AFL-CIO, accessed August 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aflcio.org/Legislation-and-Politics/State-Legislative-Battles/Ongoing-State-Legislative-Attacks/Right-to-Work-for-Less">http://www.aflcio.org/Legislation-and-Politics/State-Legislative-Battles/Ongoing-State-Legislative-Attacks/Right-to-Work-for-Less</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p04">In a collective bargaining process, both parties are legally bound to bargain in good faith. This means they have a mutual obligation to participate actively in the deliberations and indicate a desire to find a basis for agreement. There are three main classification of bargaining topics: mandatory, permissive, and illegal. Wages, health and safety, management rights, work conditions, and benefits fall into the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mandatory category</a><span class="glossdef">A collective bargaining topic, such as wages, that must be discussed in the agreement.</span></span>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Permissive topics</a><span class="glossdef">Topics in collective bargaining that are not mandatory but still topics of discussion, such as drug testing.</span></span> are those that are not required but may be brought up during the process. An example might include the requirement of drug testing for candidates or the required tools that must be provided to the employee to perform the job, such as a cellular phone or computer. It is important to note that while management is not required by labor laws to bargain on these issues, refusing to do so could affect employee morale. We can also classify bargaining issues as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">illegal topics</a><span class="glossdef">A bargaining topic that is illegal in both the bargaining agreement and within society, such as plans to discriminate against a specific group in employment.</span></span>, which obviously cannot be discussed. These types of illegal issues may be of a discriminatory nature or anything that would be considered illegal outside the agreement.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p05">The collective bargaining process has five main steps; we will discuss each of these steps next. The first step is the preparation of both parties. The negotiation team should consist of individuals with knowledge of the organization and the skills to be an effective negotiator. An understanding of the working conditions and dissatisfaction with working conditions is an important part of this preparation step. Establishing objectives for the negotiation and reviewing the old contract are key components to this step. Both sides should also prepare and anticipate demands, to better prepare for compromises.</p>

            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 11.7</span> Steps in Collective Bargaining</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p06">The second step of the process involves both parties agreeing on how the timelines will be set for the negotiations. In addition, setting ground rules for how the negotiation will occur is an important step, as it lays the foundation for the work to come.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p07">In the third step, each party comes to the table with proposals. It will likely involve initial opening statements and options that exist to resolve any situations that exist. The key to a successful proposal is to come to the table with a “let’s make this work” attitude. An initial discussion is had and then each party generally goes back to determine which requests it can honor and which it can’t. At this point, another meeting is generally set up to continue further discussion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p08">Once the group comes to an agreement or settlement (which may take many months and proposals), a new contract is written and the union members vote on whether to accept the agreement. If the union doesn’t agree, then the process begins all over again.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ramifications of a Bargaining Impasse</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p01">When the two parties are unable to reach consensus on the collective bargaining agreement, this is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bargaining impasse</a><span class="glossdef">Inability to agree on a contract.</span></span>. Various kinds of strikes are used to show the displeasure of workers regarding a bargaining impasse. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economic strike</a><span class="glossdef">A strike based on unhappiness about economic conditions.</span></span> is a strike stemming from unhappiness about the economic conditions during contract negotiations. For example, 45,000 Verizon workers rallied in the summer of 2011 when contract negotiations failed.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_015">Dan Goldberg, “Verizon Strike Could Last Months,” <em class="emphasis">New Jersey News</em>, August 7, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/verizon_workers_outline_differ.html">http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/verizon_workers_outline_differ.html</a>.</span> The two unions, Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers, claim that the new contract is unfair, as it asks Verizon workers to contribute more to health plans, and the company is also looking to freeze pensions at the end of the year and reduce sick time.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_016">Dan Goldberg, “Verizon Strike Could Last Months,” <em class="emphasis">New Jersey News</em>, August 7, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/verizon_workers_outline_differ.html">http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/verizon_workers_outline_differ.html</a>.</span> Verizon says the telecommunications business is changing, and it cannot afford these expenses.

A bargaining impasse could mean the union goes on strike or a lockout occurs. The goal of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lockout</a><span class="glossdef">When organizations do not allow workers to go to work.</span></span>, which prevents workers from working, is to put pressure on the union to accept the contract. A lockout can only be legally conducted when the existing collective bargaining agreement has expired and there is truly an impasse in contract negotiations. In summer 2011, the National Basketball Association locked out players when the collective bargaining agreement expired, jeopardizing the 2011–12 season<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_017">Steve Kyler, “Division among Owners?” <em class="emphasis">HoopsWorld</em>, August 8, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hoopsworld.com/nba-am-division-among-nba-owners/">http://www.hoopsworld.com/nba-am-division-among-nba-owners/</a>.</span> while putting pressure on the players to accept the agreement. Similarly, the goal of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strike</a><span class="glossdef">Workers protest and do not go to work as a result of contract disagreement. </span></span> is to put pressure on the organization to accept the proposed contract.

As mentioned under the Taft-Hartley Act, wildcat strikes are illegal, as they are not authorized by the union and usually violate a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sympathy strikes</a><span class="glossdef">Work stoppages by other unions designed to show support for the union on strike.</span></span> are work stoppages by other unions designed to show support for the union on strike.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Working with Labor Unions as Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p01">First and foremost, when working with labor unions, a clear understanding of the contract is imperative for all managers. The contract (also called the collective bargaining agreement) is the guiding document for all decisions relating to employees. All human resources (HR) professionals and managers should have intimate knowledge of the document and be aware of the components of the contract that can affect dealings with employees. The agreement outlines all requirements of managers and usually outlines how discipline, promotion, and transfers will work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p02">Because as managers we will be working with members of the union on a daily basis, a positive relationship can not only assist the day-to-day operations but also create an easier bargaining process. Solicitation of input from the union before decisions are made can be one step to creating this positive relationship. Transparent communication is another way to achieve this goal.</p>

                <li>A union has two goals: to add new members and to collect dues. A <em class="emphasis">check-off provision</em> of a contract compels the organization to take union dues out of the paycheck of union members.</li>
                <li>In a <em class="emphasis">union shop</em>, people must join the union within a specified time period after joining the organization. This is illegal in <em class="emphasis">right-to-work states</em>. An <em class="emphasis">agency shop</em> is one where union membership is not required but union dues are still required to be paid.

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Collective bargaining</em> is the process of negotiating the contact with union representatives. Collective bargaining, to be legal, must always be done in good faith.</li>
                <li>There are three categories of collective bargaining issues. <em class="emphasis">Mandatory issues</em> might include pay and benefits. <em class="emphasis">Permissive bargaining</em> items may include things such as drug testing or the required equipment the organization must supply to employees. <em class="emphasis">Illegal issues</em> are those things that cannot be discussed, which can include issues that could be considered discriminatory.</li>
                <li>The collective bargaining process can take time. Both parties prepare for the process by gathering information and reviewing the old contract. They then set timelines for the bargaining and reveal their wants and negotiate those wants. A <em class="emphasis">bargaining impasse</em> occurs when members cannot come to an agreement.</li>
                <li>When a bargaining impasse occurs, a <em class="emphasis">strike</em> or <em class="emphasis">lockout</em> of workers can occur. An <em class="emphasis">economic strike</em> occurs during negotiations, while an <em class="emphasis">unfair labor practices strike</em> can occur anytime, even during negotiations. A <em class="emphasis">sick-out</em> can also be used, which is when workers call in sick for the day. These strategies can be used to encourage the other side to agree to collective bargaining terms.</li>
