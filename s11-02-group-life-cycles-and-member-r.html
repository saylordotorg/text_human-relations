Just as you were once born and changed your family, they changed you. You came to know a language and culture, a value system, and set of beliefs that influence you to this day. You came to be socialized, to experience the process of learning to associate, communicate, or interact within a group. A group you belong to this year—perhaps a soccer team or the cast of a play—may not be part of your life next year. And those who are in leadership positions may ascend or descend the leadership hierarchy as the needs of the group, and other circumstances, change over time.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Group Life Cycle Patterns</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p01">Your life cycle is characterized with several steps, and while it doesn’t follow a prescribed path, there are universal stages we can all recognize. You were born. You didn’t choose your birth, your parents, your language, or your culture, but you came to know them through communication. You came to know yourself, learned skills, discovered talents, and met other people. You learned, worked, lived, and loved, and as you aged, minor injuries took longer to heal. You competed in ever-increasing age groups in your favorite sport, and while your time for each performance may have increased as you aged, your experience allowed you to excel in other ways. Where you were once a novice, you have now learned something to share. You lived to see some of your friends pass before you, and the moment will arrive when you too must confront death.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p02">In the same way, groups experience similar steps and stages and take on many of the characteristics we associate with life.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_005">Moreland, R., &amp; Levine, J. (1982). Socialization in small groups: Temporal changes in individual group relations. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 15</em>, 153.</span> They grow, overcome illness and dysfunction, and transform across time. No group, just as no individual, lives forever.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p03">Your first day on the job may be comparable to the first day you went to school. At home, you may have learned some of the basics, like how to write with a pencil, but knowledge of that skill and its application are two different things. In school, people spoke and acted in different ways than at home. Gradually, you came to understand the meaning of recess, the importance of raising your hand to get the teacher’s attention, and how to follow other school rules. At work, you may have had academic training for your profession, but the knowledge you learned in school only serves as your foundation—much as your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">socialization</a><span class="glossdef">The process of learning to associate, communicate, or interact within a group.</span></span> at home served to guide you at school. On the job they use jargon terms, have schedules that may include coffee breaks (recess), have a supervisor (teacher), and have rules, explicit and understood. On the first day, it was all new, even if many of the elements were familiar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p04">In order to better understand group development and its life cycle, many researchers have described the universal stages and phases of groups. While there are modern interpretations of these stages, most draw from the model proposed by Bruce Tuckman.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_006">B. Tuckman, “Developmental Sequence in Small Groups,” <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin</em> 63, (1965): 384–99.</span> This model, shown in <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch19_s02_s01_t01">Table 7.2 "Tuckman’s Linear Model of Group Development"</a>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_007">Tuckman, B.

This stage is also called the orientation stage because individual group members come to know each other. Group members who are new to each other and can’t predict each other’s behavior can be expected to experience the stress of uncertainty. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Uncertainty theory</a><span class="glossdef">States that we choose to know more about others with whom we have interactions in order to reduce or resolve the anxiety associated with the unknown.</span></span> states that we choose to know more about others with whom we have interactions in order to reduce or resolve the anxiety associated with the unknown.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_008">Berger, C., &amp; Calabrese, R.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> The more we know about others and become accustomed to how they communicate, the better we can predict how they will interact with us in future contexts. If you learn that Monday mornings are never a good time for your supervisor, you quickly learn to schedule meetings later in the week. Individuals are initially tentative and display caution as they begin to learn about the group and its members.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p06">If you don’t know someone very well, it is easy to offend. Each group member brings to the group a set of experiences, combined with education and a self-concept. You won’t be able to read this information on a nametag, but instead you will only come to know it through time and interaction. Since the possibility of overlapping and competing viewpoints and perspectives exists, the group will experience a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">storming stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time of struggles as group members themselves sort out their differences.</span></span>, a time of struggles as the members themselves sort out their differences. There may be more than one way to solve the problem or task at hand, and some group members may prefer one strategy over another. Some members of the group may be more senior to the organization than you, and members may treat them differently. Some group members may be as new as you are and just as uncertain about everyone’s talents, skills, roles, and self-perceptions. The wise business communicator will anticipate the storming stage and help facilitate opportunities for the members to resolve uncertainty before the work commences. There may be challenges for leadership, and there may be conflicting viewpoints. The sociology professor sees the world differently than the physics professor. The sales agent sees things differently than someone from accounting. A manager who understands and anticipates this normal challenge in the group’s life cycle can help the group become more productive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p07">A clear definition of the purpose and mission of the group can help the members focus their energies. Interaction prior to the first meeting can help reduce uncertainty. Coffee and calories can help bring a group together. Providing the group with what they need and opportunities to know each other prior to their task can increase efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p08">Groups that make a successful transition from the storming stage will next experience the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">norming stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when the group establishes norms, or informal rules, for behavior and interaction.</span></span>, where the group establishes norms, or informal rules, for behavior and interaction. Who speaks first? Who takes notes? Who is creative, who is visual, and who is detail-oriented? Sometimes our job titles and functions speak for themselves, but human beings are complex. We are not simply a list of job functions, and in the dynamic marketplace of today’s business environment you will often find that people have talents and skills well beyond their “official” role or task. Drawing on these strengths can make the group more effective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p09">The norming stage is marked by less division and more collaboration. The level of anxiety associated with interaction is generally reduced, making for a more positive work climate that promotes listening. When people feel less threatened and their needs are met, they are more likely to focus their complete attention on the purpose of the group. If they are still concerned with who does what and whether they will speak in error, the interaction framework will stay in the storming stage. Tensions are reduced when the normative expectations are known and the degree to which a manager can describe these at the outset can reduce the amount of time the group remains in uncertainty. Group members generally express more satisfaction with clear expectations and are more inclined to participate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p10">Ultimately, the purpose of a work group is performance, and the preceding stages lead us to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performing stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when the group accomplishes its mandate, fulfills its purpose, and reaches its goals.</span></span>, in which the group accomplishes its mandate, fulfills its purpose, and reaches its goals. To facilitate performance, group members can’t skip the initiation of getting to know each other or the sorting out of roles and norms, but they can try to focus on performance with clear expectations from the moment the group is formed. Productivity is often how we measure success in business and industry, and the group has to produce. Outcome assessments may have been built into the system from the beginning to serve as a benchmark for success. Wise managers know how to celebrate success, as it brings more success, social cohesion, group participation, and a sense of job satisfaction. Incremental gains toward a benchmark may also be cause for celebration and support, and failure to reach a goal should be regarded as an opportunity for clarification.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p11">It is generally wiser to focus on the performance of the group rather than individual contributions. Managers and group members will want to offer assistance to underperformers as well as congratulate members for their contributions. If the goal is to create a community where competition pushes each member to perform, individual highlights may serve your needs, but if you want a group to solve a problem or address a challenge as a group, you have to promote group cohesion. Members need to feel a sense of belonging, and praise (or the lack thereof) can be a sword with two edges: one stimulates and motivates while the other demoralizes and divides.</p>

            <p class="para">The movie <em class="emphasis">Remember The Titans</em> shows the group development process. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p12">Groups should be designed to produce and perform in ways and at levels that individuals cannot, or else you should consider compartmentalizing the tasks. The performing stage is where the productivity occurs, and it is necessary to make sure the group has what it needs to perform. Missing pieces, parts, or information can stall the group and reset the cycle to storming all over again. Loss of performance is inefficiency, which carries a cost. Managers will be measured by the group’s productivity and performance. Make sure the performing stage is one that is productive and healthy for its members.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p13">Imagine that you are the manager of a group that has produced an award-winning design for an ecologically innovative four-seat car. Their success is your success. Their celebrations are yours even if the success is not focused on you. A manager manages the process while group members perform. If you were a member of the group that helped design the belt line, you made a fundamental contribution to the style of the car. Individual consumers may never consider the line from the front fender, across the doors, to the rear taillight as they make a purchase decision, but they will recognize beauty. You will know that you could not have achieved that fundamental part of car design without help from the engineers in the group, and if the number-crunching accountants had not seen the efficiency of the production process that produced it, it may never have survived the transition from prototype to production. The group came together and accomplished its goals with amazing results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p14">Now, as typically happens, all groups will eventually have to move on to new assignments. In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adjourning stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when group members leave the group.</span></span>, members leave the group. The group may cease to exist or it may be transformed with new members and a new set of goals. Your contributions in the past may have caught the attention of the management, and you may be assigned to redesign the flagship vehicle, the halo car of your marque or brand. It’s quite a professional honor, and it’s yours because of your successful work in a group. Others will be reassigned to tasks that require their talents and skills, and you may or may not collaborate with them in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p15">You may miss the interactions with the members, even the more cantankerous ones, and will experience both relief and a sense of loss. Like life, the group process is normal, and mixed emotions are to be expected. A wise manager anticipates this stage and facilitates the separation with skill and ease. We often close this process with a ritual marking its passing, though the ritual may be as formal as an award or as informal as a “thank you” or a verbal acknowledgement of a job well done over coffee and calories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p16">On a more sober note, it is important not to forget that groups can reach the adjourning stage without having achieved success. Some businesses go bankrupt, some departments are closed, and some individuals lose their positions after a group fails to perform. Adjournment can come suddenly and unexpectedly or gradually and piece by piece. Either way, a skilled business communicator will be prepared and recognize it as part of the classic group life cycle.</p>

            <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Without a doubt, most if not all of us will work in groups in our workplace. Even if we seem to have a somewhat isolated job, part of what we do will impact others. Developing skills that can help us work better in these groups relates to the social awareness and relationship management aspects of emotional intelligence, as we discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Achieve Personal Success"</a>. <strong class="emphasis bold">These two skills—the ability to understand social cues that can be affecting others and our ability to communicate and maintain good relationships—are the cornerstones in any group situation.</strong></p>
            <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p02">For example, in the group development process, we depend greatly on our social awareness skills in order to make successful first impressions during the forming stage. We use our ability to resolve conflict during the storming and norming phase. Having the skills to handle these different phases are key to successful and productive group work. Have you ever worked with a dysfunctional group, perhaps on a class project? These types of groups are lacking in communication and possibly emotional intelligence skills, which can make the group more cohesive. <strong class="emphasis bold">Group cohesiveness is the goal in any type of group setting. This makes the performing stage more productive, less stressful, and maybe even enjoyable!</strong></p>

However, in the meantime, you have also been interviewing with other potential employers, and you are waiting to hear back from two of them. You are still a potential member.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p05">After careful consideration, you decide to take the job offer and start the next week. The projects look interesting, you’ll be gaining valuable experience, and the commute to work is reasonable. Your first day on the job is positive, and they’ve assigned you a mentor. The conversations are positive, but you feel lost at times, as if they are speaking a language you can’t quite grasp. As a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">new group member</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who is still learning the group’s norms and rules.</span></span>, your level of acceptance will increase as you begin learning the groups’ rules, spoken and unspoken.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_013">Fisher, B.

Decision emergence: Phases in group decision making. <em class="emphasis">Speech Monographs, 37</em>, 56–66.</span> You will gradually move from the potential member role to the role of new group member as you learn to fit into the group.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p06">Over time and projects, you gradually increase your responsibilities. You are no longer looked at as the new person, and you can follow almost every conversation. You can’t quite say, “I remember when,” because your tenure hasn’t been that long, but you are a known quantity and know your way around. You are a full member of the group. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Full members</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who is a known quantity, is familiar with the group’s norms, and feels free to express opinions.</span></span> enjoy knowing the rules and customs and can even create new rules. New group members look to full members for leadership and guidance. Full group members can control the agenda and have considerable influence on the agenda and activities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p07">Full members of a group, however, can and do come into conflict. When you were a new member, you may have remained silent when you felt you had something to say, but now you state your case. There is more than one way to get the job done. You may suggest new ways that emphasize efficiency over existing methods. Coworkers who have been working in the department for several years may be unwilling to adapt and change, resulting in tension. Expressing different views can cause conflict and may even interfere with communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p08">When this type of tension arises, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">divergent group members</a><span class="glossdef">Individuals who pull back, contribute less, and start to see themselves as separate from the group.</span></span> pull back, contribute less, and start to see themselves as separate from the group. Divergent group members have less eye contact, seek out each other’s opinion less frequently, and listen defensively.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p09">After several months of trying to cope with these adjustments, you decide that you never really investigated the other two companies, that your job search process was incomplete. Perhaps you should take a second look at the options. You will report to work on Monday but will start the process of becoming an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ex-member</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who no longer belongs to a group.</span></span>, one who no longer belongs. You may experience a sense of relief upon making this decision, given that you haven’t felt like you belonged to the group for a while. When you line up your next job and submit your resignation, you make it official.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p10">This process has no set timetable. Some people overcome differences and stay in the group for years; others get promoted and leave the group only when they get transferred to regional headquarters. As a skilled business communicator, you will recognize the signs of divergence, just as you have anticipated the storming stage and do your best to facilitate success.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p02">Now that we’ve examined a classical view of positive and negative group member roles, let’s examine another perspective. While some personality traits and behaviors may negatively influence groups, some are positive or negative depending on the context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p03">Just as the class clown can have a positive effect in lifting spirits or a negative effect in distracting members, a dominator may be exactly what is needed for quick action. An emergency physician doesn’t have time to ask all the group members in the emergency unit how they feel about a course of action; instead, a self-directed approach based on training and experience may be necessary. In contrast, the pastor of a church may have ample opportunity to ask members of the congregation their opinions about a change in the format of Sunday services; in this situation, the role of coordinator or elaborator is more appropriate than that of dominator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p04">The group is together because they have a purpose or goal, and normally they are capable of more than any one individual member could be on their own, so it would be inefficient to hinder that progress. But a blocker, who cuts off collaboration, does just that. If a group member interrupts another and presents a viewpoint or information that suggests a different course of action, the point may be well taken and serve the collaborative process. But if that same group member repeatedly engages in blocking behavior, then the behavior becomes a problem. To become effective at human relations skills, learn how to work in groups. The use of emotional intelligence skills in relationship management can help achieve this goal.</p>

                <li>Groups and their individual members come together and grow apart in predictable patterns.</li>
                <li>Group lifecycle patterns refer to the process or stages of group development.</li>
                <li>There are five stages to the group development process, which include forming, norming, storming, performing, and adjourning.</li>
                <li>Within each of the stages, group members have a variety of roles, which include potential member, new member, full member, divergent member, marginal member, and an ex-member.</li>
                <li>You can take on a variety of roles when working with a group. These roles can be positive or negative, and you can rely on your emotional intelligence skills to make sure they are positive.</li>

                <li>In the course where you are using this book, think of yourself and your classmates as a group. At what stage of group formation are you currently? What stage will you be at when the school year ends?</li>
                <li>Think of a group you no longer belong to. At what point did you become an ex-member? Were you ever a marginal group member or a full member? Write a two- to three-paragraph description of the group, how and why you became a member, and how and why you left. Share your description with a classmate.</li>
